        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.memory = memory
    
    def run(self, task):
        # Perceive
        context = self.memory.get_context()
        
        # Reason
        plan = self.llm.plan(task, context)
        
        # Act
        results = self.execute_plan(plan)
        
        # Learn
        self.memory.store_experience(task, plan, results)
        
        return results
```

### ReACT Pattern
```python
class ReACTAgent:
    def run(self, query):
        for iteration in range(self.max_iterations):
            # Reason
            thought = self.reason(query, context)
            
            # Act
            if self.should_act(thought):
                action = self.act(thought)
                observation = self.observe(action)
            else:
                return self.final_answer(thought)
```
