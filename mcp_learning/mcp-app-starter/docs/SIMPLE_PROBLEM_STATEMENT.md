# MCP App Starter - Simple Problem Statement

## What We Need to Build

1. **Build a billing system** that demonstrates how AI can interact with business applications using Model Context Protocol (MCP)
2. **Create an MCP server** that exposes billing tools (create invoice, get invoice) to AI systems
3. **Build a backend** that connects to the MCP server and provides a REST API for web applications
4. **Create a React frontend** that lets users create invoices and see real-time progress updates
5. **Implement real-time updates** using Server-Sent Events (SSE) to show AI operation progress
6. **Make it educational** with comprehensive documentation so teams can learn MCP patterns
7. **Create a template** that can be reused for other business domains (CRM, inventory, etc.)
8. **Use modern tech stack** (Node.js, TypeScript, React, Express) with best practices
9. **Keep it simple** but production-ready patterns for demonstration purposes
10. **Deliver everything** in 2-3 weeks as a complete learning resource and reusable template

## Success Criteria
- Working end-to-end application with AI integration
- Team can understand and replicate the patterns
- Template can be adapted for other business domains
- Comprehensive documentation for learning and reference
